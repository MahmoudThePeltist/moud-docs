# Guide

## Getting killed

Becoming dead is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ give me death
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Death is granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're dead:

{% code title="ded.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I ded'
```
{% endcode %}
